# Red-Dead-Redemption-16-BIT-Train-Attack
We created a remake of Red Dead Redemption with SNES limitation in Game Maker Studio 2. 

The Game is inspired by an available mission of the Rockstar Game Red Dead Redemption 2, where we have to go on a train and attack people inside. 
In the begining of the game we had a cinematic where we can see 2 brothers of the Reno Gang on horses. 
The Reno Gang is also known as the Reno Brothers Gang and The Jackson Thieves, is a group of criminals that operated in the Midwestern United States during and just after the American Civil War. 
Though short-lived, they carried out the first three peacetime train robberies in U.S. history.
Most of the stolen money was never recovered.
